The building, Collegiate Gothic with modernistic Arts & Craft and Art Nouveau touches, is of brick and seam-faced granite with limestone trim.  James Gamble Rogers was the architect. The use of various interconnected low buildings, grouped around two courts with a central fourteen-story tower was characteristic of Rogers conscious effort to create urban compositions. The Hall was designed to be self-contained.  It includes dormitory accommodations for students, faculty apartments, and classrooms, lecture halls, faculty offices, dining hall and common rooms. The office of the Provost is also located here..
