                "BUILDING_PROSE": "Was built for Aaron Skinner, who ran a private boy\u2019s school.. Town and Davis were the architects and Nahum Hayward the builder. It is a two-story Greek revival residence, built similar to and to compliment the grand Hillhouse Mansion at the top of the hill in Sachem\u2019s Woods.  There is a two-story main portico fronting Hillhouse with tall slender windows whose profile extends to the portico floor, and the stucco exterior is scored to give the impression of large blocks of dressed marble, giving the mansion a true Temple effect.  When completed in 1839, it became one of the most distinguished homes on the Avenue.  Shortly after Mr. Skinner\u2019 s death (1858) Judge William Boardman acquired the property. He remodeled the house on designs by Henry Austin. This work filled in the second story angles that flank the portico, changing the cruciform plan to cube. The house was purchased in 1908 by Rutherford  Trowbridge and in 1910 a large, sweeping center stair hall, music room and expanded dining room were completed, with a wing to the west and a bay to the north. The  curved leaded glass dining room windows and grand side entrance doors were taken from the demolished Trowbridge home on the Green.  The house remained in the Trowbridge family until the death of Miss Rachel Trowbridge, when the estate became the property of the University. The house is being restored and renovated in 1999 for use by the neighboring the School of Management. Although the building will not be physically linked with the adjoining Complex, landscaping will unite the facilities, creating a campus setting for SOM.  Landmark plaque.",

                "BUILDING_PROSE": "Built 1837 as an Italianate villa, the architect is reputed to be Alexander Jackson Davis of the illustrious Town and Davis. The house was originally built for Mrs. Elizabeth Cogswell Davenport Apthorp. With four daughters, she conducted Mrs. Apthorp\u2019s Young Ladies Seminary. In 1846, Mr. Joseph Sampson, husband of daughter Emily Sophia, purchased house and Mrs. Apthorp lived there until her death in 1877. In 1877, Frederic W. Stevens (BA 1858) and Mrs. Stevens gave the Property to the University. In 1878 it was rented to Professor Theodore Salisbury Woolsey, BA 1872 (1878-84). And in 1890 it was rented to Mrs. and  Miss Cady\u2019s Boarding and Day School for Girls. In 1899 it came into possession of President Timothy Dwight, and  was subsequently the residence of Mrs. Jane Skinner Dwight (d. 1919).  Mrs. Dwight\u2019s Son, Winthrop E. Dwight, BA 1893, resold house to University in 1928, and it was rented to Charles P. Howland, BA 1891 (1928-35). The house was then home to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine (1935-46) and the Agriculture Extension Service (1943-46). In 1946 it was converted to dormitory for women students in Art and Music schools; offices of Sigma Xi and the Research Society of America. In 1960 it became laboratories for Peabody Museum; Department of History of Science and Medicine, and in 1974 the School of Organization and Management, now the School of Management.

At that time, most of the Victorian decoration was removed, and the brick facade was entirely covered with stucco. The structure continued as a privately owned residence until 1954, when the house was sold to the University. The facility was converted for institutional use and was assigned to the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics. Enclosure and expansion of the rear porch are and partitioning of interior spaces was undertaken in the 1970's. It currently houses classrooms, a library, and offices. A below-grade common room flanked by courtyards was designed in 1994 by Charles Beckman Swanson Associates connects number 28 to 30 Hillhouse.",

When constructed, a new building technique used a wood framing system filled with tap rock and then covered with stucco. In 1871, the house was sold, the masonry walls removed and the building disassembled. One section of the house went to 87 Trumbull Street, the other to Davenport Avenue. The reconstructed Federal Style house was covered with new clapboard following the original lines and new trimmings were added, including arched gable windows, window heads, and a porch. The brick  wings and a room over the porch were added at the turn of the century. The University purchased the house in 1926, and minor renovations made",

Mr. David C. Collins purchased the house in 1850. He died in 1861 and his widow, Clarissa, resided there until her death at age 100 in 1914. Mr. Henry H. Townsend lived in the house until 1953. Some time during this period, a remodeling project removed the original main roof parapet and the antiflexes at the porch roof, and added bay windows and a rear wing. The residence was acquired by the University in 1953 and served for a short time as a dormitory for engineering graduate students.

James Abraham, who may have had Ithiel Town draw plans for the front façade, provided designs. The house was rented to John Baker Church in 1845 (Mrs. Church was Maria Trumbull Silliman). The residence was purchase three years later by Yale President Noah Porter, who had it extensively remodeled between 1866 and 1870 by Henry Austin. Renovations included the mansard roof addition, bargeboards with filigreed angles, and two Victorian porches. Upon Noah Porter\u2019s demise in 1992, the house was bequeathed to his two daughters, Misses Rebecca Taylor and Martha Day Porte. Further renovations were completed in the early 20th century, returning the house to Federal style (the porches were removed during the course of this work.) Miss Martha Porter bequeathed the property to the University in 1919 subject to life use by Miss Porter. The house has been used as a residence for University administrators.

There is a suite for visiting scholars. Hammered concrete aggregate, producing a corrugated surface both inside and out, and glass was used for this nine-story building (seven above ground and two below) with 36 different floor levels.  Iron gates, designed by Louis Sullivan for elevator cages in the demolished Garrick Theater building and Stock Exchange in Chicago, have been used effectively, together with a variety of objects of art from all periods. Paul Rudolph was the architect. In 1970 the building underwent alterations in conjunction with restoration work required to repair the damage sustained from a significant fire. Numerous changes have been made to the interior of the building, such as, enclosing open office areas, replacing the upper-ground level snack bar with exhibition space, and replacing the penthouse apartment with a new snack bar. The building is presently having major renovations to its exterior and support systems, and will soon undergo comprehensive programmatic alterations in conjunction with an ongoing Arts Area programmatic study.

The use of various interconnected low buildings, grouped around two courts with a central fourteen-story tower was characteristic of Rogers conscious effort to create urban compositions. The Hall was designed to be self-contained.  It includes dormitory accommodations for students, faculty apartments, and classrooms, lecture halls, faculty offices, dining hall and common rooms.

Graves, it was sold in 1866 (prior to completion) to Tredwell Ketcham, who gave it to his daughter Mary, wife of Professor Gilman (later president of the U of California). In 1872 George B. Farnam, M.D. 1896 (d. 1886) purchased the property; ownership passed in 1886 to Mrs. Farnam (d. 1907). Purchased by the University from Thomas W. Farnam in 1921, it was leased to Mrs. Anna W. Whitecomb (1922-45); then converted into ten two-room apartments for married students (1946-57). The facility was again remodeled in 1957 when the Department of Economics was moved there, and continues to serve this function today.",

The building was designated as the University Clinic and included the New Haven Dispensary which served as the outpatient department of the New Haven Hospital and was staffed by the School of Medicine; in 1930 this work was transferred to the Clinic Building.  The Dental Clinic Society of New Haven, Inc. used the Hope Building for about twenty-five years.  (The address at that time was 321 Congress Avenue.)  Since 1960 the facilities have been used for medical research and administrative offices. The architect was L. W. Robinson. It originally had the address 321 Congress Avenue, but in 1982 the building was completely renovated to provide teaching facilities for the School of Medicine and the address was changed. The adaptive reuse received a merit award from the New Haven Preservation Trust. The architects for the project were Alexander Purves and Allan Dehar. [315 Cedar Street]",

Beinecke, PH.B. 1909, Mrs. Walter Beinecke, whose husband was in the Class of 1910, and other members of the family. The building is constructed of translucent, gray-veined Vermont Montclair Danby marble, framed by shaped light warm gray Vermont Woodbury granite. The low-ceiling entrance expands into the exhibition hall; around its perimeter is a mezzanine approached by two stairways. The floor surrounding the sculpture court contains the reading room, facilities for scholars, a catalogue and reference room, curator offices, and other rooms and equipment for the proper use of the books and manuscripts. The stacks will accommodate 800,000 volumes for which temperature and humidity controls are provided. Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill was the architect. The court is made of white Imperial Danby marble and framed in granite. Isamu Noguchi designed it. Intended to evoke the imagination, the massive symbolic sculptures are a sun (energy), a pyramid (geometry of the earth, or of the past), and a cube (chance). [123 Wall Street",

The well-known landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmstead advised in the land\u2019s development. [217 Prospect Street]",

The college is named to honor Bishop George Berkeley, in recognition of his gifts to Yale in 1732-22. Berkeley is a cluster of  medieval English Manor  buildings. Various high pitched slate roofs create an unstudied effect, as additons had been added over time. There are, in fact, but two buildings and all construction took place in 1933.  Situated on Cross Campus, the two buildings align to form an overall rectangle, separated 150 ft. by a plaza (tunnels connect the two buildings). The area between is landscaped with a stepped paved plaza leading down from the main entrance for Sterling Memorial Library, across Rose Walk, to the manicured lawn covering the subterranean Cross Campus Library.  James Gamble Rogers was the architect for the college. Berkeley  stands on the former site of the Berkeley Oval, and the new \u201challs \u201c have been named to commemorate the previous halls: Berkeley, Fayerweather, Haughton, Lampson, and White. The college contains dormitory accommodations for students, the College Dean\u2019s office, rooms for Fellows, a library, common rooms, and dining hall. The Porter Gateway on Elm Street is located between Calhoun and Berkeley colleges, at the start of Blount Avenue, the pedestrian walk across Cross Campus. Designed by Howells and Stokes and erected in 1912, the gateway is a memorial to Noah Porter, the eleventh president of Yale, and was built to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth.

It is a brick building with limestone trim in Georgian style, designed by Grosvenor Atterbury, Architect.  For many years it provided facilities for the departments of Psychiatry and Psychology, the Yale Psychiatric Institute, and the Child Study Center. In 1976 all these activities except the Child Study Center were relocated. Alterations were begun under Douglas Orr, de Cossy, Winder & Associates, Architects, to provide research laboratories for the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Department of Human Genetics, and the Section of Cell Biology.  Funding for the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center was received from the National Cancer Institute, the State of Connecticut, and others, and for the Department of Human Genetics from the Kresge Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund. In 1977 the extension of the I wing underground provided new quarters for the The Child Study Center, funding from Department of Health, Education & Welfare & other sources. In 1980 a  bridge building over Cedar Street connected the I  wing and the Winchester Building of  Y-NHH, providing additional Cancer Center and Human Genetics research facilities.

These buildings surround a single court where the arms of South Carolina and the United States may be seen in the spandrels over the main gateway. John Russell Pope Associates was the architect. An extensive renovation and reconfiguration of suites and common areas was conducted in 1989. Herbert S. Newman & Associates was the architect. In sharp contrast to the original concept of clustered suites around a central stair walk-up, this renovation organized student rooms along a central public corridor, reflecting modern design concepts concerning dormitory space.

Savage, B.F.A. 1924, painted the mural at the west end of the central section. The early literary societies are commemorated in the Linonia and Brothers reading room and on an upper floor the \"Yale Library of 1742\" is entered through the doors of the Reverend Samuel Russel\u2019s house in Branford where the founders met. The library is so designed that all public reading rooms and departments are on the entrance floor; the stacks occupy 16 floors in the tower. J. Russell Bailey was the architect for alterations in the order and catalogue departments in 1964. In 1963 the completion of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library resulted in the transfer of these holdings; the former Rare Book Room is now used for the Manuscripts and Archives Department.  The building has underground annex stack area adjacent to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and the main library. Skidmore Owens and Merrill, architects completed it in 1970. In 1971 the Cross Campus addition to the library was finished. It is a two-story facility that lies immediately underneath the Cross Campus and is connected to the Sterling Memorial Library by tunnel under High Street. The professional schools of Art, Divinity, Drama, Forestry, Law, and Medicine maintain separate libraries and many departments have special collections adjacent to their teaching facilities. In 1992 the section of High Street covering the block at the library was closed to vehicles, paved and landscaped to create a unified lawn with Cross Campus. The walkway is accented with a sculpture titled The Women\u2019s Table.The library began a comprehensive capital improvement program in 1992 that is not only renovating and restoring the original structure, but addressing the needs of air conditioning and telecommunication facilities.  A library addition completed in 1998 incorporates and encloses the northwest cloister will house the School of Music Collection, previously located in Sprague Hall.

It is a nine-story building providing facilities for the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health on six floors and on three floors for the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, (formerly the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratories located in the Rockefeller Institute, New York City). The auditorium is named for Professor C. E. A. Winslow who inaugurated the work in Public Health at Yale in 1915. The building was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant from the U S Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, a bequest of Baroness Elisabeth von Everfeldt (which also provides for a computer center in this laboratory), the Avalon Foundation, and Yale University. Philip Johnson, with the Office of Douglas Orr, associated architects, designed the building. An underground addition was constructed in 1982 to relocate the Cancer Epidemiology Unit from 30 College Street, and in 1992 a Chemical Waste Storage Facility was added in the service area.

Funds construction and remodeling were provided from the bequest of Frederick W. Vanderbilt, PH.B. 1876; Eggers & Higgins were the architects. The college honors Benjamin Silliman, BA 1796, and Professor of Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology from 1802 to 1853. There are accommodations for students, the College Dean\u2019s office, rooms for Fellows, a library, dining hall, common rooms, and a Master\u2019s house. A stone plaque in the wall on Temple Street near Grove marks the location of the house of the lexicographer Noah Webster, BA 1778.  See also the 1977 edition of  The Residential Colleges of Yale University.- Byers Hall was completed in 1903 and originally served as a center for the social and religious life of the students of the Sheffield Scientific School. Mrs. Alexander McBurney Byers of Pittsburgh gave it to the University in 1901 in memory of her husband and their son, Alexander McBurney Byers, Jr., and PH.B. 1894. The site was a bequest from John Phelps Atwater, BA 1834, and M.D. 1837. The architects, Hiss & Weekes, used Indiana limestone in a modified French Renaissance style to harmonize with the bicentennial buildings opposite. The University Treasurer had his office in Byers Hall from 1933 to 1939. The front of the building was altered, the entrance stairs eliminated, and the interior remodeled when this building was made a part of Silliman College. The Hall underwent an extensive interior restoration in 1992 after sustaining serious fire damage.  Vanderbilt-Scientific Halls  were built in 1903-06, the gift of Frederick W. Vanderbilt, PH.B. 1875, as a memorial to his brother, Cornelius Vanderbilt, MA Hon. 1894. They are Industrial Collegiate Gothic dormitories of Indiana limestone. Sperry and Treat designed Van Sheff Dorm 1 (Wall Street) in 1902, and the smaller Van Sheff Dorm 2 (College Street) in 1903 (completed by Charles C. Haight in 1906). The College Street building,  featuring a center six-story tower over a gateway became the formal entrance to Silliman College. The college underwent considerable restoration to its exterior and renovations to dormitory bathrooms in the 1990's.  A fire damaged the old Byer\u2019s Hall (dean\u2019s quarters, library and dining hall)  in 1991 necessitating a major restoration overseen by the firm of Byer, Blinder and Belle.

It was erected in 1764-67 for John Pierpont and his bride and remained in his immediate family until 1900. In 1921 the University purchased the house from the Reverend Anson Phelps Stokes, BA 1896, MA HON. 1900, LL.D. 1921 (Secretary of the University 1899-1921), who bought it in 1900 and added two wings at the rear; during his occupancy the Yale Foreign Missionary Society and the Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene were founded in the \u201ckeeping room\u201d. Acquired in 1921, the house was made available for use by the faculty in 1922 and organization of the Club was effected soon afterwards; through the generosity of a friend of the faculty in 1929 the building was renovated and refurbished as an eighteenth-century house. J. Frederick Kelly was the architect for the restoration. An entrance wing and the conversion of the open court to provide additional dining space were the gift in 1950-51 of Mrs. James Rowland Angell in memory of her husband who was President of the University 1921-1937.

It houses a nearly encyclopedic survey of the pictorial arts in Britain from Elizabethan times until the middle of the nineteenth century, including more than 1,500 paintings, 20,000 prints, 10,000 drawings, 20,000 rare books, and a small representative group of sculptures. Marshall Meyers, of the firm of Pellecchia and Meyers Architects completed the building, designed by Louis I. Kahn before his death in 1974.  The center is 200 feet long and 120 feet wide and rises four stories. A series of small shops, incorporated into the structure at street level, serves to maintain the traditional commercial activity of the street and to animate the otherwise austere facade of the concrete frame, filled with dull \u201cpewter- finish \u201c stainless steel panels, punctuated by reflective plate glass windows. The interior, by contrast, integrates the public exhibition galleries and study facilities by means of a series of finely appointed, room-like spaces gathered around two open interior courts, brightly lit by skylights. The skylights, covering the entire roof, contain baffles, filters, and diffusers, which modify light and screen out the direct rays of the sun. White oak paneling, linen-covered walls, and natural wool carpeting bordered by strips of travertine marble present a low-contrast background to the works of art. In addition to exhibition galleries, the center contains a print, drawing, and rare book study, a reference library, a photographic archive, a paper conservation laboratory, a lecture hall, faculty offices, and classrooms.

This 2 1/2 story Italianate Villa was designed by Henry Austin in 1849 (north wing added and house renovated in 1905). The cube shaped house has a low sloping hip roof with a cupola and extended eaves, and is decorated with ornate wood cornices and small porch. The original sand color of the stucco is meant to simulate stone, and pencilling joints in the stucco suggest ashlar stonework. In 1935 wings were added to the building.  The house was purchased in 1962 from the estates of Mary Dana Brown and William B. Dana and occupied by the Labor and Management Library and the Department of Industrial Administration 1964. The Department of Statistics now uses it. The building underwent extensive restoration work in 1996. It is listed as a National Historic Landmark and carries the Landmark Plaque of the New Haven Preservation Trust. North Campus [13.17]",

The style is an eclectic mix of brownstone, cobbled clay tile and clay roofing, reflecting the whimsical treatment in vogue with fraternity architecture at Yale. The 1915 /17 addition, designed by Metcalfe & Ballantyne, New York, was built on the stable yard. In 1933 it was given to the University in memory of William W. Skiddy, PH.B. 186,( a founder member of the Society in 1863), and Wyllys E. Dowd, Jr., PH.B. 1900.The building is the home of the Yale Career Services offices. North Campus [14.11]",

The building was renovated and a first-floor kitchen wing that followed the angle of the adjoining canal was added in 1930 (architect, R. W. Foote) and another smaller kitchen wing, with associated revisions was completed in 1949 (architect Andrew Euston).  Since 1960, the building has housed over 300 musical instruments owned by the University, known appropriately as the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments. The harpsichord teaching and practice studios are also in this building. North Campus [14.09]",

Additional gifts from members of his family defrayed the major expense. A competition was held in 1866 for the Chapel design as a Civil War memorial chapel. Standing on the corner of College and Elm streets, between Durfee and Farnam halls, this High Victorian Gothic building of rough brown New Jersey and Ohio sandstone was designed by Russell Sturgis, Jr. Robbins Battell, BA 1839, and Mrs. Ellen Battell Eldridge presented the chimes, consisting of five bells, in 1882. In 1893 the seating capacity was increased by an addition to the south by Cady, Berg & See, Architects. An extensive renovation took place in 1927 under the direction of Everett V. Meeks. The chapel has many memorials recording service to the University by members of the faculty. Andrew F. Euston planned and supervised the remodeling of the memorial apse, and designed the carving on altar, reredos, and stalls, dedicated October 5, 1947, to sixteen undergraduate deacons who died in the Second World War. The transept organ (built by Walter Holtkamp), a memorial to Ellen Battell Stoeckel, and the choir organ, commemorating three sons of Samuel Thorne, BA 1896 - Lewis, BA 1931, M.D. 1936, Peter B., Class of 1940, and J. Neale, Class of 1942 - were dedicated on October 14, 1951. The interior underwent an extensive historic restoration in 1984. [400 College Street]",

In 1954 additional space was provided for the library which was remodeled under the direction of J. Russell Bailey.

                "BUILDING_PROSE": "And Saybrook College were converted in 1933 from what was originally built as the Memorial Quadrangle to become Yale\u2019s first two residential colleges. The original building of seam-faced granite, Indiana limestone, Briar Hill sandstone (and other stone from Idaho, Virginia and Connecticut) was completed in June 1921. The cornerstone was laid on October 8, 1917, the two-hundredth anniversary of the raising of the first college building, but construction was interrupted by World War I. This first extensive dormitory built by the university was the gift of Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness of New York City. It honors her son, William Harkness, BA 1883, who had died in 1916. The quadrangle, \"Collegiate Gothic\" in style, with its warm Medieval English Manor flavor imparts a welcoming, residential feeling to what is essentially an extensive student housing unit. It is the prototype for all of Yale\u2019s cloistered colleges, being composed of a cluster of various sized halls surrounding interior courts. As well as the student rooms, each college has rooms for Fellows, a common room, a dining hall, activity rooms in the basement and a Master\u2019s House. James Gamble Rogers was the architect for the original construction and the conversion. The work was made possible by the generosity of Edward S. Harkness.  Branford College containing 157, 642 gross square feet, was named for the town in which a group of Connecticut ministers met in 1701 to establish in the Colony the Collegiate School which later became Yale University. This is a complex of many different buildings arranged around several courts and fills the southern part of the block bounded by York Street, Library Walk, and High Street.  Main gates from York and High streets lead to Branford Court, with access to Brothers in Unity, Calliope and Linonia courts. The heights of the buildings vary from two to four stories.  The main High Street entrance is flanked by Harkness Tower designed to complement the Collegiate Gothic style of the complex. Elaborately decorated carvings, Gothic arches, pinnacle, and turrets are woven within the architectural facade.  The Memorial Room at its base is now known as Branford College Chapel, dedicated in 1952 to the thirty-five members of the College who gave their lives serving their country in 1941-1951. The ten tower bells were replaced by one of the world's finest carillons in 1966, with the installation forty-four bells (the gift of an anonymous donor) that came from Loughborough, England, where the original bells were made. Concerts are given by the Guild of Yale University Bell Ringers.",

Harkness, BA 1897, and MA HON. 1925, to provide facilities for students of architecture. The University purchased the property in 1917 from George Douglas Miller, BA 1870. Mr. Miller had acquired the site in 1907-08 and the stone in 1911 (including the towers of Alumni Hall) to build a dormitory for Skull and Bones as a memorial to his son. After initial construction from designs of Tracy & Swartwout, it had remained unfinished. The name honors John Ferguson Weir, MA HON. 1871, the first Director of the School of Fine Arts. The architect who finished the building was Everett V. Meeks. Jonathon Edwards College now uses most of the rooms. In 1965 the building was remodeled according to plans of Charles Brewer, Jr. Architect, to provide offices for fellows and to house the Robert a. Taft Memorial Library.

Charles C. Haight was the architect. In 1976 major renovations were completed with funds given by John Hay Whitney, BA 1926. Edward L. Barnes, Architect. In sharp contrast to the original concept of clustered suites around a central hall walk-up, this renovation organises student rooms along a central public corridor, reflecting modern design concepts concerning dormitory space.

                "BUILDING_PROSE": "In 1928, the Yale School of Fine Arts moved from the Art Building (now known as Street Hall) into this four-story \u201cexpansion \u201c  building.   Considered \u201cTuscan Romanesque,\u201d this solid and monumental structure of Aquila sandstone (Ohio sandstone trim) is linked to Street Hall by an elegant bridge that arches over High Street (it houses a grand high-ceilinged  gallery). The true visual appearance of architect Edgerton Swartwout\u2019s planned gallery can not be appreciated, as he intended the gallery to be extended along Chapel Street when additional funds were made available  (original funding, Edward S. Harkness, BA 1897, MA HON. 1925). The  new wing of the Art Gallery (of an equal visual mass): the proposed extension along Chapel Street, was not the romantic design of Mr. Swartwout, but the 1953 bold modernistic brick and glass creation of Louis I. Kahn (with the Office of Douglas Orr).  His four-story geometric box contrasts sharply with the ornate buildings surrounding it. Kahn used string courses to delineate interior floor lines to scale down and break up his massive unrelieved brick walls along Chapel Street ) contrasted with Swartwout\u2019s use of medieval elements to resolve this same issue).  In the rear, Kahn\u2019s three tiered rear courtyards serve as  sculpture  garden and outdoor retreat. The gardens, with their picturesque view of the cluster of  mediaeval English  styled  buildings beyond (Jonathan Edwards College and Weir Hall) are seen to good advantage from  well-placed window walls on each floor of the gallery. This building was Kahn\u2019s first public commission and the first building in modern style on the Yale Campus ) funded by gifts of alumni and friends). In 1965 renovations created a design center (architect: Carlton Granbery) and between 1974 and 1976 portions of the building complex were expanded and renovated. In 1971 the Cambridge Seven Association designed the conversion of the large lecture room and adjacent exhibition areas to provide space and offices for the Yale Center for American Art and Material Culture (the Garvin Collection) . In 1977, an underground lecture hall was constructed beneath the sculpture garden between the Art Gallery and Weir Hall (architect: Herbert S. Newman and Associates). The Art Gallery is home to  more than forty thousand works of art. This includes the Garvan Collection of American painting and decorative arts, twentieth-century and old master paintings and sculptures, and a large collection of prints, drawings and photographs. There is also on display Greek and Roman antiquities,  artifacts from Dura-Europa,  African and pre-Columbian art, and Oriental art. As previously mentioned, sculpture is exhibited in the three courtyards.  Part of the original building is used by the History of Art Department. Colonel John Trumbull 1756-1843 (his painting of the American Revolution formed the nucleus for a Gallery of Art at Yale College in 1832) and his wives are buried in a vault in the original gallery\u2019s basement.

Built between 1750 and 1753 by masons Francis Letort and Thomas Bills, it was constructed as a three-story brick.  Funds were secured through a lottery held by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1747, the sale of a French vessel taken by the frigate belonging to the Colony, and a grant from the Connecticut Assembly in 1751. In 1797 John Trumbull added a fourth story. He felt the original roof did not blend with buildings planned in the adjacent area, so at great expense the gambrel roof was rebuilt in a Modish Adam style.  In 1882 the dormitory was thoroughly remodeled and known as South Middle College until 1905, when alumni funds financed another remodeling under Grosvenor Atterbury, Architect. The original roofline and name (Connecticut Hall) was resumed. 1909 to 1941 the first floor was used for offices of the Dean of Yale College. Through a gift from the Old Dominion Foundation (founded by Paul Mellon, BA 1929) renovation again took place in 1952-54 by the Office of Douglas Orr and Richard A. Kimball. The building was gutted and the interior completely rebuilt.  It now provides the Yale College faculty meeting room, Literature and Philosophy departmental offices, seminar rooms, and a basement computer lab, National Historic Landmark & the Landmark plaque of New Haven Preservation Trust.
